“Valia” is a 1907 short story by Leonid Andreyev. In the story, the author emphasizes that the setting where the character Valia is reading is nearly silent: ______

**Question**
Which quotation from “Valia” most effectively illustrates the claim?

**Choices**
(a)“The hand in which he carried his book was getting stiff with cold, but he would not ask his mother to take the book from him.”
(b)“Valia was reading a huge, very huge book, almost half as large as himself.”
(c)“Valia approached the window and examined the toys.”
(d)“Everything in the room was quiet, so quiet that the only thing to be heard was the rustling of the pages he turned.”

**Feedback**
**Correct Answer:** (d)
Choice D is the best answer because this quotation most effectively illustrates the claim that the author emphasizes the near silence of the setting where the character Valia is reading. In the quotation, the author highlights the near silence of the setting by twice using the word “quiet” to describe the room. The author also calls attention to the fact that Valia is reading in a nearly silent setting by noting that the only sound to be heard is that of the pages being turned.

Oluwaseyi Moejoh cofounded U-recycle Initiative Africa when she was only a teenager. Moejoh and her team founded the organization to teach young people how their actions affect the environment and why recycling is important. For example, the organization put on an exhibit of art made using recycled materials. 

**Question**
According to the text, what is one reason Moejoh and others founded U-recycle Initiative Africa?

**Choices**
(a)To bring attention to overlooked African artists
(b)To teach young people why recycling is important
(c)To help adults gain important outdoor skills
(d)To give teenagers advice about starting businesses

**Feedback**
**Correct Answer:** (b)
Choice B is the best answer because it describes a reason that Moejoh and team founded U-recycle Initiative Africa. The text mentions two reasons the initiative was founded: to teach young people about how they affect the environment and to teach them “why recycling is important.” Thus, teaching the importance of recycling to young people accurately describes a motivation that the text cites as a reason for the initiative’s founding.

Astronomers investigated the Arabia Terra region of Mars because it appears to contain irregularly shaped craters that may have been caused by massive volcanic explosions. In their investigations of Arabia Terra, the researchers found remnants of ash deposits in an amount and thickness that would result from a massive volcanic eruption. However, erosion and past resurfacing events could have modified the surface of the planet. Therefore, ______

**Question**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Choices**
(a)the current makeup of the Arabia Terra region might not accurately reflect the volcanic activity of Mars’s past.
(b)eruptions from Mars’s volcanoes were likely not as massive as astronomers previously believed.
(c)ash was most likely expelled from multiple different volcanoes on Mars’s surface.
(d)the craters found in the Arabia Terra region were necessarily created by events other than volcanic eruptions.

**Feedback**
**Correct Answer:** (a)
Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the Arabia Terra region of Mars. According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text goes on to note, however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current conditions on Mars’s surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events—some signs of past events could have been transformed or erased entirely—and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reflect past volcanic activity.

Mosses can struggle in harsh desert conditions because these plants require enough sunlight for photosynthesis but not so much that they risk drying out. Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia caninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California’s Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these semitransparent rocks benefited the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S. caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the shoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that ______

**Question**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Choices**
(a) S. caninervis is one of the few types of moss that can survive under semitransparent rocks.
(b)quartz crystals do not transmit the necessary sunlight for photosynthesis in S. caninervis.
(c) S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.
(d)quartz crystals are capable of supporting S. caninervis growth if the crystals are not too thin.

**Feedback**
**Correct Answer:** (c)
Choice C is the best answer because  it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species need sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.

Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______

**Question**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Choices**
(a) Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.
(b) some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.
(c) Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.
(d) the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.

**Feedback**
**Correct Answer:** (b)
Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.
